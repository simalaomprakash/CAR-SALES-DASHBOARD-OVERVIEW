As a data analyst, I'm thrilled to share insights from my latest project â€“ creating a comprehensive car sales dashboard using Power BI. This dashboard provided our team with a deep dive into the performance of various car brands, empowering us to make informed, data-driven decisions.

The dataset included sales information for a wide range of car companies, including Ford, Dodge, KIA, Cadillac, Toyota, Chevrolet, and Mitsubishi. I carefully analyzed the data to uncover key trends and patterns, which were beautifully visualized in the Power BI dashboard.

## Standout Findings

- **Geraldine Buddy Storbeck's Diesel Service Inc**: Sold a Ford Black Expedition for $26K.
- **Gia C & M Motors Inc**: Sold a Dodge Black Durango for $19K.
- **Gianna Capitol KIA Cadillac**: Sold a Red Eldorado for $31.5K.
- **Giselle Chrysler of Tri-Cities**: Sold a Toyota Pale White Celica for $14K.
- **Grace Chrysler Plymouth Acura**: Sold a Red TL for $24.5K.

These insights allowed our team to better understand the market, identify top-performing models, and make strategic decisions to drive sales growth. The dashboard also revealed that our YTD total sales reached $371.2M, a 23.59% increase from the previous period.
